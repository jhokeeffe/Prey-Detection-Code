Computational models of praying mantis prey detection

generateModelOut.m produces prey detection model output and stimulus and filter fourier analysis, given input files FM,EM,DB,LF,TM (set on line 15).
PlotFigure.m  takes data already produced by generateModelOut.m (saved as PlotData.mat) and produces the figure seen in 'Nityananda, V., Oâ€™Keeffe, J., Umeton, D., Simmons, A. and Read, J.C., 2019. Second-order cues to figure motion enable object detection during prey capture by praying mantises. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 116(52), pp.27018-27027.'
